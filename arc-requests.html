          <h2>Do I Need to Submit an ARC Request Application?</h2>

          <p>In most cases, any exterior modification requires prior approval from the Architectural Review Committee (ARC). However, there are certain common repairs and modifications that have been granted “blanket approval” by the ARC and do not require submission of an ARC Request Application.
          </p>
          <p>These typically include items that have been reviewed frequently and for which the ARC has established clear, specific guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>Before starting any project, you should carefully review the current Architectural Guidelines document to determine whether your planned repair or modification qualifies for blanket approval.
          </p>
          <p>We do not want homeowners to submit an ARC Request Application if one is not required. If you are unsure whether your project needs approval, please contact the ARC Chair for clarification before proceeding.
          </p>
          <p><b><em>Please note that the nominal application fee submitted with an ARC Request is non-refundable</b></em>.

          <h2>Why Do I Need to Submit an Architectural Review Committee (ARC) Application?</h2>

          <p>Every Member of the Ravinia Villas Homeowners Association agreed, at the time of purchase, to comply with the Association’s governing documents, as they may be amended from time to time. These documents include architectural standards that help preserve the appearance, harmony, and property values within our community.
          </p>
          <p>The Architectural Review Committee (ARC) plays an important role in maintaining a consistent look, feel, and standard throughout Ravinia Villas. Architectural guidelines naturally evolve over time as styles change, materials improve, and community input is considered. Because of this, it can be difficult for any individual homeowner to stay fully aware of all current requirements and restrictions.
          </p>
          <p><b><em>The ARC review process is designed to protect homeowners.</em></b> By reviewing proposed exterior modifications in advance, the Committee helps ensure that projects comply with the Association’s guidelines before a homeowner invests time and money—only to later discover that the improvement does not meet community standards.
          <p>If you wish to make any change to the exterior of your home, you are required to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Review the most current Architectural Guidelines document available on Vantaca.</li>
            <li>Submit an ARC Request Application and <b><em>receive approval before beginning your project</b></em>.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Submitting an application is not meant to delay improvements—it is intended to ensure fairness, consistency, and the continued beauty of our community.
          </p>
         </div>

       <div class="card">

         <h2>How Much Does an ARC Request Application Cost?</h2>

         <p>The nomial fee to submit an Architectural Review Committee (ARC) Request Application is currently $25.00 (as of Feb 2026) but is always subject to change.  Please check the latest ARC Request Application available on Vantaca.
         </p>
         <p>This nominal fee is charged by our Management Company and DOES NOT go to the Association.  This fee offsets the administrative costs associated with processing, reviewing, and maintaining official records of applications.
         </p>
         <p>Please note:
         </p>
         <ul>
             <li>The fee must be submitted at the time the application is filed.
             </li>
             <li>An application will not be considered complete until payment is received.
            </li>
             <li>Ensure you include all aspects of your project on the same application to avoid having to submit an additional ARC Request Applicaiton and additional fee.
            </li>

            <li><b><em>The application fee is non-refundable, regardless of the outcome of the review.</em></b>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>Submitting a complete application with the required fee helps ensure timely review of your request.

        <div class="card">

          <h2>What Happens If I Fail to Submit an ARC Application Before Starting My Project?</h2>

          <p>If you begin an exterior project without first submitting an Architectural Review Committee (ARC) Request Application, you will receive a written notice from the Association requiring you to submit an application.
          </p>
          <p>This requirement applies regardless of whether your project ultimately complies with the current Architectural Guidelines.
          </p>
          <p><b><em>It is important that you do not ignore the initial notice. Continued noncompliance may result in additional notices and potential fines, as authorized by the Association’s governing documents and applicable Florida Statutes.</b></em>
          </p>
          <p>Once you submit a complete and detailed ARC Request Application, your project will be reviewed as though it had not yet been started or completed. The Committee’s decision will be based solely on whether the project complies with the Architectural Guidelines:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>If the project complies, it will be approved.
              </li>
              <li>If the project generally complies but requires minor modifications, it may be approved with conditions. You will be required to complete those modifications or revert back the project to its original condition.
             </li>
             <li>If the project does not comply and would require significant changes to meet the Guidelines, it will be denied. In that case, you will be required to restore the property to its original condition.
             </li>
          </ul>
          <p><b><em>Submitting an ARC application before beginning your project protects you from unnecessary expense, delays, and potential enforcement action. For that reason, it is extremely important to obtain approval in advance of starting any exterior modification.</b></em>
