        <h2>Electronic Voting Returned in 2025</h2>
        <p>In 2017, Ravinia homeowners voted to amend our By-Laws to allow for E-Voting and document transmission. While E-Voting was used in the past, the last several elections reverted to paper ballots only. The 2025 Board of Directors voted to reintroduce E-Voting—this time using a much-improved and user-friendly system.
        </p>
       <p>Members can sign up and consent to electronic voting (E-Voting) by completing a <a href="forms/Ravinia E-Voting Consent Form v2.pdf" target="_blank"><em><b>E-Voting Consent Opt-In Form</b></em></a>. Of course, if you prefer the traditional method, paper ballots will always remain an option.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Why Choose Electronic Voting?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>No login required</b> – Just click the secure link sent to your inbox.</li>
            <li><b>Eco-friendly</b> – No printing, mailing, or envelopes.</li>
            <li><b>User-friendly interface</b> – Clear instructions, built-in checks, and vote confirmation.</li>
            <li><b>Faster results</b> – Speeds up vote tallying and reporting.</li>
            <li><b>Vote from anywhere</b> – As long as you have internet access.</li>
            <li><b>Less Error Prone</b> – Every year, paper ballots are submitted that must be discarded due to errors filling out the ballot.  E-Voting Ballots have checks to prevent such errors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Electronic Voting Process<h2>
            
        <h3>Initial Notice of an Election</h3>
        
        <p>The initial notice will be sent via E-mail prior to any Election (for Directors and/or proposed governing document amendments).
        <ol>
            <li>It will include a link to our E-Voting Simply Voting website to confirm your acknowledgement that:
                <ul>
                    <li>You can receive electronic ballots</li>
                    <li>Your device and browser are compatible with our voting system</li>
                </ul>
                If you don’t confirm by the deadline, you’ll receive a paper ballot for this election.</li>
            <li>Here is <b>SAMPLE</b> of
                <a href="https://raviniavillas.simplyvoting.com/voting/auth/proof?electionId=282178&token=06d8a339eea922dad831b46ea2714b2a31186a2046147db5407b1d01b587d41a&locale=en&segment1=&segment2=&dispSeg=1" target="_blank"><em><b>Submit Electronic Voting Acknowledgment</em></b></a>
            </li>
            <li>The notice will include the meeting purpose (i.e. Annual Membership Meeting & Board Election), date / time, location, and agenda. </li>
            <li>If the Election includes voting for new HOA Directors, the notice will include information about Qualifications for Service on the Board of Directors, an Application, along with instructions for submitting an application.</li>
            <li>Periodically, you may receive E-Mail reminders to submit your acknowledgement if you haven't done so up until the deadline.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Notice of an Election</h3>
        <p>Assuming you confirmed your acknowledgement, you will recieve an E-Mail Notice of the Meeting / Election announcing the details.
        <ol>
            <li>It will include a link to our E-Voting Simply Voting website with your electronic ballot and will include:
                <ul>
                    <li>a list of qualified members running for the Board</li>
                    <li>a list of proposed amendments to governing documents</li>
                    <li>a list of any other proposed items requiring a membership vote</li>
                </ul>
                If you don’t vote using your Electronic Ballot you will be able to receive a paper ballot and cast the paper ballot until the Ballots are officially collected by the noticed deadline.  Only one ballot will count.  Once you cast an electronic ballot, you will not be able to change your vote nor will you be able to cast a paper ballot.  If you happen to cast both an electronic and a paper ballot, only the electronic ballot will be counted and the paper ballot would be discarded.
