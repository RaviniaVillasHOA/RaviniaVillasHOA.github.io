       <h1>Architectural Review Committee</h1>
       <!-- Committee Charter -->
       <div class="card">
         <h2>Committee Charter</h2>
         <h3>Article 1: Purpose</h3>

         <p>The purpose of this Guideline is to establish the process to be used by the Architectural Review Committee, hereafter the “ARC,” to exercise the authority delegated to it by the Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions, hereafter the “CCRs,” articles, bylaws, specific guidelines and actions taken by the Ravinia Board of Directors, hereafter, the “Board,” for architectural matters.</p>

         <h3>Article 2:  Authority</h3>
         <p>1.    Article 5.1 (Amended and Restated Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions of Ravinia, 2017) of the CCRs requires the Ravinia Villa Homeowners Association, Inc., hereafter, the “HOA,” to maintain, preserve, and care for the property and to provide architectural control of Lots and Common areas.</p>
         <p>2.    Article 3.6 (Amended and Restated Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and
         Restrictions of Ravinia, 2017) of the CCRs gives the HOA a reasonable right to enter and inspect the common area and homeowner property to discharge its duties. Among the powers granted to the HOA and authorized to be delegated to the ARC are the powers to adopt, alter, amend, rescind, and enforce reasonable rules and regulations for the use of Lots consistent with the CCRs.</p>
         <p>3.    Article 7 (Certificate of Amendment to the Amended and Restated Declarations of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions of Ravinia, 2020) of the CCRs on Architectural Control establishes the board's powers to create an architectural committee to approve all exterior additions, changes, alterations, or repairs to structures and landscaping before commencement, erection, or maintenance of them.</p>

         <h3>Article 3: Creation of the Architectural Review Committee</h3>
             
         <p>The Board has established an Architectural Review Committee by resolution to exercise its powers of architectural control under the CCRs. It shall consist of not less than three (3) and not more than five (5) persons who are Lot Owners in good standing with the HOA. Committee members will be approved from time to time by the Board and shall be subject to removal by the Board at any time. The Board shall choose the committee chair. Lot owners desiring to serve on the ARC must apply for appointment on or before November 30th each year for selection by the new Board at its January meeting. A majority of members shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of business. The act of a majority of members present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be an act of the committee. The ARC shall make recommendations and submit a proposed Guideline for its operation. The ARC shall pass through to applicants all processing charges made by the HOA management company.  The ARC may retain the services of such consultants as it deems appropriate to perform its functions with prior Board approval.</p>

         <h3>Article 4: Jurisdiction of the ARC</h3>
          
         <p>The following items are set forth as a general guide to matters within the concern or jurisdiction of the ARC. This guide is intended to reflect provisions of the CCRs in all cases of purported conflict, and the CCRs are the final authority regarding Architectural Control with Ravinia.</p>

         <p>1.    Article 7 (Amended and Restated Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions of Ravinia, 2017) of the CCRs provides that areas in the back of villas, backyards, and alleyways are excluded from Architectural Control for landscaping purposes.</p>
         <p>2.    Buildings, sheds, fences, walls, mailboxes, newspaper boxes, other structures or improvements, and landscaping are considered subject to Architectural Control. Actions such as additions to, changes in, alterations of, and repairs to improvements are considered within the HOA's control. Such control includes the ability of the ARC to consider community harmony of external design and location.</p>
         <p>3.    All Lots are to be for residential use.</p>
         <p>4.    Outside antennas and poles, antenna masts, and satellite reception devices are limited to thirty (30) inches in diameter. Antenna towers and citizen band or amateur band antennas are only approved by the HOA Board. See Article 8.3 (Amended and Restated Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions of Ravinia, 2017) of the CCRs for additional specifics on satellite dish installations.</p>
         <p>5.    Article 8 (Amended and Restated Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions of Ravinia, 2017) of the CCRs contains additional specifics controlling outside lighting, parking, decorations, and landscaping. Article 8 should be reviewed before making any exterior change to a Lot.</p>
         <p>6.    Article 5.3.9 (Certificate of Amendment to the Amended and Restated Declarations of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions of Ravinia, 2020)Painting: The color of Villas is controlled by the HOA and delegated to the ARC. Conjoined Villas must agree on one (1) color scheme for all exterior surfaces, or the Villas will be repainted in the existing color at the time of HOA repainting. Owners are restricted to using only colors from the ARC-approved color pallet or otherwise approved by the committee. Painting using an unapproved color may result in repainting by the HOA at the expense of the nonconforming owners.</p>
         <p>7.    Landscaping: Changes in landscaping are considered within Architectural Control. Article 8.6 (Amended and Restated Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions of Ravinia, 2017)of the CCRs clarifies that the HOA must maintain and repair all landscaping and grass areas on Lots.</p>

         <h3>Charter Review and Amendment</h3>
         <p>This Charter may be reviewed periodically and amended by the Board of Directors to remain consistent with governing documents and community needs.</p>
