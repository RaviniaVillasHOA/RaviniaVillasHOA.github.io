      <div class="card">
        <h3>Vantaca (Owner / Accounting Portal)</h3>
        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Vantaca is the HOA accounting/owner portal where you can view account balances, statements, and pay assessments (if the HOA uses Vantaca).</p>
        <p><strong>How to get access:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>The Manager or management company usually creates an owner account in Vantaca and sends setup instructions or an invitation.</li>
          <li>Have your property address, closing statement, or account number ready when requesting access.</li>
          <li>If you need help, contact the Manager with the subject <em>Vantaca Access Request</em> (template below).</li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>Mailto template:</em></p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Electronic Notifications</h3>
        <p><strong>What:</strong> The HOA sends important notices (assessments, meeting notices, violations, safety alerts) by email and sometimes by SMS.</p>
        <p><strong>How to sign up:</strong> Sign up in Townsquare or ask the Manager to add your preferred email and phone number to the notification list.</p>
        <p><strong>Recommended:</strong> Use a primary email you check regularly and optionally add a phone number for SMS alerts.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Election Voting</h3>
        <p><strong>What to know:</strong> HOA elections may offer electronic voting, paper ballots, or both depending on the governing documents and the election year.</p>
        <p><strong>How to register:</strong> Ensure your owner contact info is current in Vantaca and Townsquare. If the HOA offers electronic voting, the Manager or Election Committee will send registration/ballot instructions before the election.</p>
        <p><strong>If you want to vote electronically:</strong> Email the Manager with the subject <em>Register for Electronic Voting</em> and confirm your preferred contact method.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>What the Manager Might Ask For</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Owner name exactly as on the deed.</li>
          <li>Property address (unit/lot number if applicable).</li>
          <li>Closing date or a copy of closing statement.</li>
          <li>Preferred contact email and phone number.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Having this information ready speeds up portal setup and access to statements and voting.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Privacy &amp; Security</h3>
        <p>Keep your portal credentials private. The HOA will never ask you to share passwords. Beware of phishing attempts — if you receive a suspicious message claiming to be from the HOA, verify with the Manager before clicking links.</p>
      </div>
